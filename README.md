# Kafka Explaination
## Objective 
The functionality objective is to implement Kafka in my project. I notice that my project needs a messaging system to create events, and
I choose Kafka because it is a framework that handles it so well. The implementation goal was to create two Kafka topics
to handle the mail and stock management services.Â
