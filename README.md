# Kafka Explaination
## Objective 
The functionality objective is to implement Kafka in my project. I notice that my project needs a messaging system to create events, and
I choose Kafka because it is a framework that handles it so well. The implementation goal was to create two Kafka topics
to handle the mail and stock management services.Â

## NGROk

 * For testing purposes, I use Ngrok to start a server. However, I recommend using it only for testing.
Here is the Ngrok documentation to implement it: [NgRok Documentation](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/linux)

## Docker 

* You can pull the Docker image using this command:
 ```dotdocker
docker pull guilhermebauer/real-timedeliverytrackingsystem
```

DB_USERNAME= your_username
DB_PASSWORD= your_password
DB_PORT= your_database_port
